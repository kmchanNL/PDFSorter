Problem: Scanning with the HP Laserjet Document Feeder only supports single side scans.

Solution: By using code from https://bskinn.github.io/Scan-PDF-Merging/ and tweaking it to select the two document with PySimpleGUI, this code selects two pdfs to one. Ideally name the documents _odd.pdf and _even.pdf
